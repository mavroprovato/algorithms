Algorithms
==========

A library that implements various data structures and algorithms in C.

The algorithms implemented are:

* Various sorting algorithms:
    * [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
    * [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
    * [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
    * [Shellsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort)
    * [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
    * [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [Disjoint-set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) data structure (Union-Find).
* [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_\(abstract_data_type\)) implementation based on resizing arrays.
* [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_\(abstract_data_type\)) implementation based on resizing arrays.

Also, some test programs are included that used these data structures and algorithms:

* A test sorting program.
* A program to test for balanced parentheses.
* A program that checks for grid percolation.
